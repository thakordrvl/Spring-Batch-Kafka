# Spring Batch CSV to Kafka Integration

## Overview

This Spring Boot application integrates Spring Batch to read data from a CSV file and publish it to a Kafka topic. The application includes a REST API controller that triggers the batch job, allowing for easy interaction and automation of data processing workflows. The CSV data is mapped to a payload named `Person`, enabling structured handling of the data.

## Features

- **CSV File Reading**: Utilizes Spring Batch's `ItemReader` for efficient data extraction from CSV files.
- **Kafka Integration**: Publishes data to a specified Kafka topic using Spring Batch's `ItemWriter`.
- **API Triggering**: Supports initiating the batch job through a REST API, allowing for integration with other systems.
- **Custom Serialization**: Configures serialization settings for Kafka, ensuring that the `Person` objects are correctly serialized when sent to the topic.

## Technologies Used

- **Spring Boot**: Framework for developing the application.
- **Spring Batch**: For batch processing tasks.
- **Apache Kafka**: For messaging and data streaming.
- **REST API**: For job triggering and interaction.

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```

2. **Build the Application**:
   Use Maven to compile and package the application:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

3. **Run the Application**:
   Start the Spring Boot application using:
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

4. **Configure Kafka**:
   Ensure you have a running Kafka instance and update the `application.properties` file with the necessary configurations, including `bootstrap.servers`.

## API Endpoint

### Trigger Batch Job

- **Endpoint**: `GET /joblauncher/job1`
- **Description**: Initiates the batch job to read from the CSV file and write to the Kafka topic.

## Kafka Configuration

The Kafka configuration file is responsible for establishing the producer settings and serialization of the `Person` data being sent to Kafka.

### Example Configuration

```java
@Configuration
public class KafkaConfig {
    @Bean
    public ProducerFactory<String, Person> producerFactory() {
        // Configuration details for the Kafka producer
    }
    
    @Bean
    public KafkaTemplate<String, Person> kafkaTemplate() {
        // Kafka template for sending messages
    }
}
```

## Conclusion

This Spring Batch application efficiently handles the reading of CSV files and the publishing of structured data to Kafka. Its design facilitates seamless integration and automation of data processing tasks, making it suitable for various applications.
